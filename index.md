## Defect Dojo 

### Description

DefectDojo is a tool created by the Security Engineering team at Rackspace to track testing efforts. It attempts to streamline the testing process by offering features such as templating, report generation, metrics, and baseline self-service tools. Though it was designed with security folks in mind, there is nothing keeping QA/QE testers, or any other testers for that matter, from using it productively.
